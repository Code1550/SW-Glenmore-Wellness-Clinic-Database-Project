# Glenmore Wellness Clinic - Frontend

Minimal Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold for the clinic frontend. Use `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

- Folder structure mirrors the project requirements: `api`, `components`, `pages`, `types`, `utils`, `hooks`.
- This scaffold contains placeholder components and utility files to be expanded.
